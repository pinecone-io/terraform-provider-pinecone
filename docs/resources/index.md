    pinecone = {
      source = "pinecone-io/pinecone"
    }
  }
}

provider "pinecone" {
  environment = "us-west4-gcp"
  # api_key = set via PINECONE_API_KEY env variable
}

resource "pinecone_index" "test" {
  name = "tftestindex"
  spec = {
    serverless = {
      cloud  = "aws"

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the index to be created. The maximum length is 45 characters.
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Optional

- `dimension` (Number) The dimensions of the vectors to be inserted in the index
- `metric` (String) The distance metric to be used for similarity search. You can use 'euclidean', 'cosine', or 'dotproduct'.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `host` (String) The URL address where the index is hosted.
- `id` (String) Index identifier
- `status` (Attributes) Status (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `pod` (Attributes) Configuration needed to deploy a pod-based index. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--pod))
- `serverless` (Attributes) Configuration needed to deploy a serverless index. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--serverless))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--pod"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.pod`

Required:

- `environment` (String) The environment where the index is hosted.
- `pod_type` (String) The type of pod to use. One of s1, p1, or p2 appended with . and one of x1, x2, x4, or x8.

Optional:

- `metadata_config` (Attributes) Configuration for the behavior of Pinecone's internal metadata index. By default, all metadata is indexed; when metadata_config is present, only specified metadata fields are indexed. These configurations are only valid for use with pod-based indexes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--pod--metadata_config))
- `replicas` (Number) The number of replicas. Replicas duplicate your index. They provide higher availability and throughput. Replicas can be scaled up or down as your needs change.
- `shards` (Number) The number of shards. Shards split your data across multiple pods so you can fit more data into an index.
- `source_collection` (String) The name of the collection to create an index from.

Read-Only:

- `pods` (Number) The number of pods to be used in the index. This should be equal to shards x replicas.'

### Nested Schema for `spec.pod.metadata_config`

Required:

- `indexed` (List of String) The indexed fields.



<a id="nestedatt--spec--serverless"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.serverless`

Required:

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) Timeout defaults to 5 mins. Accepts a string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

### Nested Schema for `status`

Read-Only:

- `ready` (Boolean) Ready.
- `state` (String) Initializing InitializationFailed ScalingUp ScalingDown ScalingUpPodSize ScalingDownPodSize Upgrading Terminating Ready
